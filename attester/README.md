# intentguard attester

The attester is the missing hardware layer for intentguard.

Intentguard makes the chain verify that an approved transaction matches a typed intent. The attester makes the signer verify that the typed intent was rendered on a device that is not the signer's everyday laptop.

Goal: a public, MIT-licensed, protocol-neutral intent-rendering device that any DeFi council can adopt.

Status: design scaffold, not firmware, not audited, not production-ready.

## One sentence

The attester is a dedicated screen and signing key that displays decoded protocol intent from an audited renderer and produces a co-signature only after physical confirmation.

## Why it matters

Intent binding is only as good as the signer review path.

If a compromised laptop renders:

```text
Routine integration update
```

while the real intent is:

```text
Transfer admin to attacker
```

then the human can still be fooled before the on-chain guard ever runs.

An attester reduces that risk by moving intent rendering and approval to a separate, narrow-purpose device.

## Target properties

- **Protocol-neutral:** works for EVM, Solana, and future chains.
- **Open:** MIT-licensed firmware, renderer libraries, schemas, and host client.
- **Small trusted surface:** no browser, no wallet extensions, no arbitrary web content.
- **Deterministic renderer:** audited schemas turn canonical intent bytes into human-readable screens.
- **Physical confirmation:** the attester signs only after button/touch confirmation on the device.
- **Separate key:** the attester key is not the council member's hot wallet, Safe owner key, or laptop key.
- **Device attestation:** the device can prove firmware identity and schema bundle hash.
- **Fail closed:** unknown schemas, unknown targets, unknown feeds, malformed payloads, and oversized intents refuse to render or sign.

## What the attester signs

The attester does not sign raw calldata. It signs a canonical attestation over:

```text
domain
chain_id_or_genesis_hash
vault
proposal_id
nonce
action_kind
target
data_hash
intent_hash
schema_id
schema_version
renderer_hash
firmware_hash
display_digest
signed_at
expires_at
```

The on-chain guard can require both:

1. signer quorum over the proposal, and
2. attester quorum over the rendered intent.

## MVP path

The first useful version does not need custom silicon.

MVP 0 can be:

- an offline mobile app or desktop app running in locked-down mode,
- open renderer library,
- deterministic schema registry,
- separate attester key,
- QR-code or USB transport,
- co-signature verified by the guard.

MVP 1 can be:

- secure-enclave-backed mobile app,
- remote attestation where available,
- signed schema bundles,
- reproducible builds.

MVP 2 can be:

- dedicated hardware device,
- secure boot,
- firmware attestation,
- supply-chain controls,
- tamper-resistant key storage.

## Message flow

```text
1. Operator drafts proposal.
2. Host client sends canonical intent bundle to attester.
3. Attester verifies schema_id and schema_version.
4. Attester renders intent on its own screen.
5. Human confirms on the attester device.
6. Attester signs the attestation payload.
7. Host submits signer signature plus attester signature.
8. intentguard verifies both before queueing.

- `firmware/README.md`: firmware requirements and non-goals.
- `client/README.md`: host-client transport requirements.

## Non-goals

- Replacing hardware wallets.
- Signing arbitrary user transactions.
- Rendering arbitrary calldata.
- Supporting every protocol without schemas.
- Hiding malicious intent from signers for speed or convenience.

## Production warning

Do not treat this folder as a working hardware wallet. It is the design basis for the next layer of intentguard.
